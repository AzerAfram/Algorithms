These are my solutions to problems from [Codeforces](codeforces.com) and [LeetCode](leetcode.com). I always try to think through to optimal/fast solutions to problems, this makes my solutions, at the very least, slightly similar to the answer. You can see my profiles for Codeforces at [aframazer](https://codeforces.com/profile/aframazer) or LeetCode at [AzerAfram](https://leetcode.com/AzerAfram/). I must admit, my variable naming in my original solutions is sometimes lacking, to say the least, but I will try my best to rename all variables according to the problem at hand. I will also only upload solutions to problems that I personally found interesting and/or challenging. Most of the solutions are written in C++ 14 though alot of those (typically solutions without any data structures besides arrays) can also be run on any other C++ version and/or C.
